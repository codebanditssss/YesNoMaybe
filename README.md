# YesNoMaybe

YesNoMaybe is a real-time opinion trading platform where users can place positions on future events. It functions similarly to a prediction market, allowing users to express their beliefs through structured "Yes" or "No" trades. The platform maintains a live order book and matches opposing opinions dynamically using a basic matching engine.

- User authentication using Supabase
